Add validator demo screenshots here. Expected filenames and dimensions:

- queue.png                 (1919x859)  — task queue with filters and rewards
- active-validation.png     (1919x859)  — active validation view: document viewer, checklist, evidence
- rewards.png               (1919x859)  — rewards and payout history
- future.png                (1919x859)  — preview of future features

Notes:
- Keep original aspect ratio; images are rendered with intrinsic sizing in Next.js <Image>.
- Larger originals are okay; 1919x859 is used to preserve consistent ratio.
- Place files directly in this folder. The app references `/screenshots/validator/<name>.png`.
